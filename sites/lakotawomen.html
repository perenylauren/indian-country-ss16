      <h1>Lakota Women</h1>
      <h3>Women are the Earth: The Impact of Sexual and Domestic Violence on Lakota Women and What They're Doing About It</h3>
	  <h4>Lauren Pereny</h4>
         <h3>// Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>It is a fair statement to say the United States is a diverse place.  Not only in race, of course, but also in religions practiced, languages spoken, sexual orientation, perspectives, ideas…the list goes on.  The American Indian community is no different; no two communities are the same.  When it comes to being a woman in the United States, like myself, the sentiment is the same.  Each of us lead different lives, have different life experiences and different goals.  There is one reality all of us must face, though: sexual assault.  The [lskdfjlksjdf] defines sexual assault as [definition].  They also say [statistic].  The numbers are even more bleak for American Indian women.  The [slkdjflksjd] say [ksdlfkjsdf].
		 <p>Just like I come to this case study with a certain perspective and cannot represent women as a whole, this research in no way can properly represent the entire American Indian community with its [number] of federally recognized tribes and many more that are not federally recognized.  In no way is this study conclusive but it is an attempt to better understand how sexual assault impacts communities and how they, specifically the Lakota Community, are responding to this epidemic.  This study also focuses on assaults on females, although I recognize this does not represent the complete picture of assaults as male and transgender victims are just as important and lsdkfjlksjfd.

		 <h3>// A Brief History of Lakota Women</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The makeup of the Lakota Community is very different from the Anglo-European constructs we are used to.  In many spaces today, gender roles are considered a negative concept, while gender differences among the Lakota were considered complementary.  Lakota women were consulted before large decisions were made and they were even women in positions of power such as warriors, medicine women, or spiritual leaders.  (Citation)  The Black Hills Center for Indian Studies is quoted saying “In Sioux society, men were the protectors, the providers; the women were the homemakers.  […]  The Lakota woman was a total individual, and her physical, spiritual, emotional, and mental makeup were not derived from the Lakota male.”  The Lakota are a matrilineal community, meaning descent is traced through the mother’s family line.  
		 <p>During my time working among the Lakota people in Mission, South Dakota, I was told a story about men and women’s roles in their community.  Women represented the Earth, giving and caring for life, while men represent the galaxy, existing to protect and provide for the Earth, roles that are viewed as both necessary and complementary.  This came up during a conversation about the hurt and pain that has been inflicted on the women of their community due to the incredibly high prevalence of both sexual assault and domestic violence.  This, however, is a relatively new phenomenon.  Pre-colonization, Mello writes, if abuses were committed, the punishments were significant.  Brothers of the women were expected to talk to, beat, or even kill the abuser and a woman who left this destructive kind of relationship where considered honorable.  Going on, she claims that a man that beat his wife was considered honorable if she left an abusive relationship.  (Citation)
		 <p>I write this history to combat preconceived notions and stereotypes of native women and to understand both the contemporary and historical lives of Lakota women.  It helps us better understand the context in which sexual abuse and violence take place.
		</p>
		<h3>// Contemporary Communities and Colonization</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>We are unable to talk about issues of sexual and domestic violence in a contemporary sense without speaking of the historical context that plays a significant role in the construction of their current reality.  As quoted in Amnesty International’s publication Maze of Injustice, Jacqueline Agtuca says “Sexual assault rates and violence against Native American women did not just drop from the sky. They are a process of history.”  When contact was made with settlers, both gender roles and kinship organization changed.  Government officials wanted to interact with male leaders and encouraged male tribe members to become the head of households.  Amnesty International, again in Maze of Injustice, makes the argument that gender-based violence was an integral part of furthering assimilation and was used as a “tool of conquest” (Citation).  Andrea Smith argues that “If sexual violence is not simply a tool of patriarchy, but is also a tool of colonialism and racism, then entire communities of color are the victims of sexual violence.” (Citation)
		<p>Racism and demeaning media tropes contribute to the dehumanization of native women’s bodies, an unavoidable consequence of hundreds of years of mistreatment that continues today.  Smith also says that the more equal traditions of tribal communities threatened the white male dominated patriarchal society we live in, so violence was used to combat this threat. (78) “In the colonial imagination,” she argues, “native bodies are immanently polluted with sexual sin.”  This has real ramifications.  Amnesty International reported that although race is not always accurately recorded, in Oklahoma and Alaska, 58 and 57.7 percent of perpetuators were non-native men, respectively, in the 18 months prior to the research being done (Citation).  This is also related to the incredibly complex questions of jurisdiction on and off of reservations and tribal sovereignty.
